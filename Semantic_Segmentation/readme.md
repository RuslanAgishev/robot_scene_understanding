## Semantic Segmentation
Road scene semantic segmentation for autonomous vehicles.
The main goal of this approach is labeling every pixel on input image with ID
corresponding to a separate class of road scene objects.
Convolutional Neuron Networks (CNNs) architectures considered here:
- [Enet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147) based on [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/03/semantic-segmentation-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) tutorial
- [Unet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) based on [keras implementation](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models) and [fastai-pytorch tutorial](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=3)
