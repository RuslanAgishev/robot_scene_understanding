## Deep learning pipeline based on [keras implementation](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models) by Pavel Yakubovsky.
The UNet (ResNet34) model is trained on [CamVid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/)
as well as [CityScapes](http://cityscapes-dataset.com/) datasets.

### Requirements
In order to be able to run jupyter-notebooks the machine with NVIDIA GPU and [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) installed is required.
